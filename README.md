 Application for bobble internship
 
 I am applying for the C++ profile and the Android development profile.
 
 ## C++ Profile
 For the C++ profile, the code is in the cpp folder.
 The solution the first question is in the file named FindTheWord and the solution to the second question is in the file named ReverseSearch.
 Both the files are of cpp format and take the path of the dictionary after they are compiled and run. Use gcc compiler to compile on linux.
 ### Problem1
 FindTheWord first asks for the path of the dictionary and then asks for the word to search. It returns the value assosiated with the word or NO if the word is not in the Dictionary.
 ### Problem2
 ReverseSearch first asks for the path of the dictionary and then asks for the number to search. It returns the word on that number, the time complexity of search is O(m), where m is then maximum length of any word in the dictionary.
 
 ## Android Dev Profile
 All the files are present in the "android" folder.
 ### Problem 1
 For Android Development profile, a flutter project is in the android folder with the name "bobble_chat". All the flutter files are in the lib folder inside this folder. 
 The ap of the application is available in the "android" folder, with the name "bobble_chat.apk".
 ### Problem 2
 The second question is in the form of a text document name "question2.txt"
