 Application for bobble internship
 
 I am applying for the C++ profile and the Android development profile.
 
 For the C++ profile, the code is in the cpp folder.
 The solution the first question is in the file named FindTheWord and the solution to the second question is in the file named ReverseSearch.
 Both the files are of cpp format and take the path of the dictionary after they are compiled and run. Use gcc compiler to compile on linux.
 FindTheWord first asks for the path of the dictionary and then asks for the word to search. It returns the value assosiated with the word or NO if the word is not in the Dictionary.
 ReverseSearch first asks for the path of the dictionary and then asks for the number to search. It returns the word on that number, the time complexity of search is O(m), where m is then maximum length of any word in the dictionary.
 
 For Android Development profile, a flutter project is in the android folder with the name "bobble_chat". The second question is in the form of a text document name "question2.txt"
